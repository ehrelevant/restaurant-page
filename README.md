# Restaurant Page

This project is a restaurant page webapp made for "The Odin Project". For this project I mainly practiced using webpack and javascript for dynamic element creation. For furture improvements, I believe I should look into improving my style and css structure. Moreover, I should look into ways to better organize my code and create simpler variable names.
